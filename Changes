Revision history for Perl extension CPANPLUS::Dist::Build.

0.06 - Fri May  4 14:11:36 2007

 - Make test suite compatible with the perl core. No functional
   changes in this release; users need not upgrade.

0.05 - Sun Mar 11 16:58:13 2007

 - Set $ENV{PERL5_CPANPLUS_IS_EXECUTING} to the full path of the
   Build.PL file when running Module::Build->new_from_context.

 - Address RT #13926: build_requires not included in prerequisites

 - Address RT #14240 Why does it say "Params::Check" in the README 
   Description?

 - Address RT #13937 Won't install without force because newer 
   version installed (from CPANPLUS 0.055?)

 - Update dependency versions in Makefile.PL
  
 - We were sending cpantesters 'pass' reports whenever --force was in
   effect, which is probably not the right thing to do. [Jos Boumans]
