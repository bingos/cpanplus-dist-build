 - Address RT #13926: build_requires not included in prerequisites

 - Address RT #14240 Why does it say "Params::Check" in the README 
   Description?

 - Address RT #13937 Won't install without force because newer 
   version installed (from CPANPLUS 0.055?)

 - Update dependency versions in Makefile.PL
  
 - We were sending cpantesters 'pass' reports whenever --force was in
   effect, which is probably not the right thing to do. [Jos Boumans]
