 - process separation for Build.PL, Build, test and install actions, 
   using IPC::Cmd
 - If M::B is version 0.31_03 or greater use 'Build prereq_data' to
   work out prereqs, otherwise fallback on poking around in _build/
   like CPAN.pm does.
 - Resolved issues with test reports for FAILs being misgraded as UKNOWN.

0.04  Wed Aug 16 22:00:18 CDT 2006

 - Address RT #13926: build_requires not included in prerequisites

 - Address RT #14240 Why does it say "Params::Check" in the README 
   Description?

 - Address RT #13937 Won't install without force because newer 
   version installed (from CPANPLUS 0.055?)

 - Update dependency versions in Makefile.PL
  
 - We were sending cpantesters 'pass' reports whenever --force was in
   effect, which is probably not the right thing to do. [Jos Boumans]
